        The beauty and importance of writing by hand is still unbeatable. However, whether manual or digital, the triggered mental mechanisms are almost the same.

        Writing following a rigid apporach: one argument, one hundred words, seamlessly picking a topic of which there is natural desire to talk about.

        These limitations in order to teach specificness without wasting resources decorating superficialities. Words are precious, they must be used with care.

        Repeating this activity will help developing many important skills, in addition to a good collection of reflections which might be useful for a future version of yourself.

        Probably only life, intended as existence, is a one way journey. Anything else recursively requires a return.
        
        As essential part of any experience, returns must be treated with care, since often difficoultes are hidden on them.
        
        Energies and time are resources that must be spread along the whole path.
        
        Returns are beautiful in the way they conclude, but also, how they force the mind to think about them. 
        
        Appreciating a return is an extreme sign of romance. It is an indication of equilibrum and ability to fully enjoy the full spectrum of an experience.
        
        When something ends, something new starts.

        The sweet taste of bitterness at night.
        
        It seems modern times require to handle this feeling with confidence, as it is very often present.
        
        It might be that this society tends to create too many expectations, or perhaps there is a shared inability of being satisfied.
        
        Maybe, when an individual reaches a certain level of knowledge, it is no longer possibile to escape this feeling.
        
        Never underestimate the importance to talk about it with others, as well as the awareness of how bitterness itself gives strength to try again.
        
        On the other hand, with slight obviousness, the only way to understand joy is to experience bitterness.
