        Paradoxically at some point in order to improve in one direction it is necessary to undertake new ones.

        This is due to the fact that arts and techniques are linked together by unidentifiable threads.

        Experience helps identifying these structures.

        Multiplication means the awareness of being able to enormously increase a total by vibrating skills that are not strictly linked to each other,
        
        obtaining a greater result than would not be possible by developing certain skills individually.

        From an economic point of view, the comparison could be made with composite interests.

        Time if used correctly is still the most exceptional of multipliers.

        There is nothing better than the feeling of having acquired rhythm, moment, inertia.
        
        Repeating an action with methodical continuity allows you to notice progress and improvements, motivational fuel to repeat the activity  again.
        
        Continuity in gestures, words, ideas, relationships. The fields of application are infinite. The benefits incalculable.
        
        Continuity creates macro structures in which it is possible to build new ones, like a puzzle without borders.
        
        One's own continuity allows others to hook into it, creating energies that move in unison.
        
        Sometimes the pleasure to interrupt continuity, in order to rediscover the need to throw yourself back in it again.

        Among the multitudes of frequencies to which each individual is subjected, the most precious are hidden, completely absorbed in a context of total noise.
        
        It is therefore unlikely to be able to capture them, unless working on the noise, reducing it as much as possible.
        
        Special frequencies will start to be easier to identify and consequently to own.
        
        High-level comparison with gravitational waves' detectors.
        
        Noise is an integral part of the human experience, an inevitable sword hanging over the head of this troubled humanity.

        A song can generate moments of clarity in which it is obvious how things will inevitably go in the desired direction.
        
        Small signals that if added together generate stronger ones. Knowing how to let those signals multiply themselves as next level, amplifing the outcome.
        
        The belief in flourishing ideas. Head held high, firm handshake, serious look, but at the same time, crazy confidence of knowing how to go exploit schemas.
        
        The belief that it will take time. It is now established how everything arrives at the right moment.

        The belief of having made the right mistakes.
        
        The belief of sowning quality that suddenly grows beauty.

        At times, unexpectedly, a feeling of difficult placement arises, leaving the mouth stuck, the mind clear, the eyes full of amazement.
        
        There is no need of natural landscapes to reach it.
        
        Sometimes, crossing a city in turmoil is enough to realize you are touching the concept of immensity.
        
        The eyes are the medium transforming the sum of images into something profound.
        
        The awareness of how everything in any case is destined to disappear in the dark depths of immensity.
        
        For this reason, perhaps, it is important from now to know how to share your world with someone else.

        There are inputs of any kind, all around, a multitude of possibilities, an endless stream of potential directions.

        Quality has a fundamental role, there is no fear in filtering out the noise.

        Fussiness and selectivity, but also receptivity, positive unexpectedness comes from complete random situations.

        Rumors whisper it seems the best ones are hidden just outside the comfort zone. 

        There is also the other side. Be a source of inputs for other people.

        Enthusiasm to discuss ideas, proposing alternatives, encouraging dreaming, finally criticize constructively.

        Receiving and giving inputs go hand in hand, two sides of the same coin, essential to each other.

        In youth changes are daily bread. A continuous, sometimes excessive search for the new.
        
        Growing up means avoiding the unplanned whenever possible, while focusing instead on specific and targeted changes.

        Everyday life shows that small changes are happening continuously all around, while switching perspective for a certain time reveals the substantial ones.

        Despite appearance seems to say that changes have occurred, for a good observer, a deeper view shows that at the end of the day, nothing has really changed.

        Arriving at this conclusion most probably means that a change has happened without being noticed on an earlier stage. The interior one.

        How dreams work is still a mystery.

        What is certain is how they give the impetus to achieve goals that are apparentely too far to reach.

        Some are so beautiful that it is even hard to think about them.

        Others are dreams to unlock new dreams, as if they are the door to access a magical world.

        Dreams are perhaps more beautiful if shared with someone. They are probably easier to achieve.

        Dreaming about someone so far away that might seem unreachable.
        
        But exactly there is the secret of the dream: never stop believing in it.

        The sweet taste of bitterness at night.
        
        It seems modern times require to handle this feeling with confidence, as it is very often present.
        
        It might be that this society tends to create too many expectations, or perhaps there is a shared inability of being satisfied.
        
        Maybe, when an individual reaches a certain level of knowledge, it is no longer possibile to escape this feeling.
        
        Never underestimate the importance to talk about it with others, as well as the awareness of how bitterness itself gives strength to try again.
        
        On the other hand, with slight obviousness, the only way to understand joy is to experience bitterness.

        Probably only life, intended as existence, is a one way journey. Anything else recursively requires a return.
        
        As essential part of any experience, returns must be treated with care, since often difficoultes are hidden on them.
        
        Energies and time are resources that must be spread along the whole path.
        
        Returns are beautiful in the way they conclude, but also, how they force the mind to think about them. 
        
        Appreciating a return is an extreme sign of romance. It is an indication of equilibrum and ability to fully enjoy the full spectrum of an experience.
        
        When something ends, something new starts.

        The beauty and importance of writing by hand is still unbeatable.
        
        However, whether manual or digital, the triggered mental mechanisms are almost the same.

        Writing following a rigid apporach: one argument, one hundred words, seamlessly picking a topic of which there is natural desire to talk about.

        These limitations in order to teach specificness without wasting resources decorating superficialities.
        
        Words are precious, they must be used with care.

        Repeating this activity will help developing many important skills, in addition to a good collection of reflections which might be useful for a future version of yourself.
