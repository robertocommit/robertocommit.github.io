        Technology
      </h2> 
      <br>Technology is shaping the present and the future of any thinkable area.
      <br>I had the opportunity to ride this wave and to make a living out of it.

        <br>
          Back in 2012, a data analyst was appetibile on the market if able to manipulate information with Microsoft Excel.
          Around 2015 a strong switch, every analytical job description was requiring at least a programming language.
          Nowadays is not enough, an analyst is complete only with advanced statistics, often defined Machine Learning.

        <br>I own a comprensive knowledge of the whole data stack, and more generally, you can talk with me about almost anything happening inside a browser.
