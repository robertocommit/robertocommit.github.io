        Technology is shaping the present and the future of any thinkable area.
        Roberto has the opportunity to ride this wave and to make a living out of it.
        Back in 2012, a data expert was appetibile on the market if able to manipulate information with Microsoft Excel.
        Around 2015 a strong switch, every analytical job description was requiring at least a programming language.
        Nowadays is not enough, a professional is complete only with advanced statistics, often defined Machine Learning.
        You can talk to Roberto about any of these topics, about anything regarding data,
        almost anything about computers, and if you would, about anything else.

        A profile can acquire technical skills in multiple ways.
        Firstly, with academical education,
        secondly with work experience,
        thirdly following ad-hoc courses,
        and lastly developing personal projects.
        But there is a skill, borderline between soft and hard, too often under the radar,
        particularly important for a data professional, extremely difficult to develop: creativity.
        Roberto believes creativity can flourish when developed within a framework of positive attitude.
        This framework requires a constant amount of fresh energy, which can only
        be obtained following and choosing a healty lifestlye.
        Moving, writing, reading, coding. Different forms Roberto uses to express himself.

        Roberto considers languages the most valuable asset an individual might have.  
        He utopically believes that if any human being would be able to speak any language,
        wars and inequalities would disappear.
        New generations must focus on languages, and institutions should put this as first priority,
        since it is during childhood that the real possibility to master an idiom can occur.
        You can fluently communicate with Roberto in Italian, English and German.
        Due to his origin, French and Spanish can be used for basic conversations.
        Currently learning Chinese following a life goal project.
