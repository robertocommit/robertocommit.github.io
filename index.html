      </h2> 
        Technology is shaping the present and the future of any thinkable area.
        Roberto has the opportunity to ride this wave and to make a living out of it.
      <p>
        Back in 2012, a data analyst was appetibile on the market if able to manipulate information with Microsoft Excel.
        Around 2015 a strong switch, every analytical job description was requiring at least a programming language.
        Nowadays is not enough, an analyst is complete only with advanced statistics, often defined Machine Learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can talk with Roberto about anything regarding data,
        almost anything about a computer,
        and more generally, about anything else.

      </h2> 
        A profile can acquire technical skills in multiple ways.
        Firstly, with academical education,
        secondly with work experience,
        thirdly following ad-hoc courses,
        and lastly developing personal projects.
        But there is a skill, borderline between soft and hard, too often under the radar,
        particularly important for a data professional, extremely difficult to develop: creativity.
      <p>
        Roberto believes creativity can flourish when developed within a framework of positive attitute.
        This framework requires a strong amount of energy, which can only be obtained with an healty lifestlye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving, writing, reading, coding, drawing. Different forms Roberto uses to express himself.
