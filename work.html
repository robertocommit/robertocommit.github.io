        This page (<i>steadily under development</i>) has the goal to illustrate what Roberto is
        able to achieve practically speaking, giving for each activity a brief description.
        All these skills have been learnt during previous work experiences,
        but also building personal projects or experiments.

        <div class="content">
          The way an organisation implement and structure a BI tool is one of the first
          signals about potential inefficiencies. At a certain level, from inside an organisation
          it is not possible anymore to understand opportunities and limitations. 
          This is why having a professional looking at the tool from different angles 
          cane be extremely valuable.

        <b class="h2">BI Maintenance</b>
        <div class="content">
          BI tools require regular maintenance. From managing permissions to 
          relocate queries, the number of daily hidden small tasks necessary to keep a system healthy 
          and up to date is often underestimated. Any organisation would require a specific role to take 
          care of these aspects, but it is not always the case, leading during time to outdated systems.

        <div class="content">
          Queries are getting slower, or they are presenting wrong results, and you do not know why.
          With patience and dedication, even the most complex query can be divided into small pieces of code,
          making easier to debug it understanding what is not working, and most importantly, why.

        <div class="content">
          Nobody likes slow queries. Data needs to be delivered fast to enhance decisions 
          and move business forward. Sometimes queries can be written better, while in other cases
          tables' structure can be optimised allowing faster results. Moreover, queries' style must be
          consistent, allowing a smart reuse of the code already written.

        <div class="content">
          Any company faces the need to extract data from the web. For a multitude of reasons, having
          the possibility to acquire data previously not available can lead to competitive advantages.
          Data are out there, but often not easy to access, because of time constraints or technical limitations.
          Rely on reliable and scalable web crawlers to bring your data to a next level.

          The biggest part of a machine learning project is the iterative process of
          features defining and features improvement. This activity can be considered boring
          from a data scientist point of view, because not directly connected with algorithms behind the learning pipeline. However, this part is crucial and important as the algorithm itself if not even more.

          KPIs are at the core of a business. Theoretically, any process would require monitoring by a KPI.

          Once an ETL pipeline is done, it is time to test if outputs are correct.
          This activity is extremely important and can be achieved using proper techniques and technologies.
          A good practice is to let evaluate the correctness of an ETL not to the person who has written it.
