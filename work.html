        <div class="content">
          This word officially does not exists, and it is often used in conjunction with digitalization.
          It gives a powerful understanding of what companies, 
          which are transitioning from old managament paradigms to new ones, are looking for to survive.
          Datalizations brings digitalisation. 
          A company able to rely on a strong and flexible data structure is a company that can take data drive decisions.

        <div class="content">
          The way an organisation implements and structures a BI tool is one of the first
          signals about potential inefficiencies. At a certain point within an organisation
          it is not possible anymore to understand opportunities and limitations. 
          Having a professional looking at the tool from different angles 
          can be extremely valuable.

        <div class="content">
          BI tools require regular maintenance. From managing permissions to 
          relocate queries, the number of daily hidden small tasks necessary to keep a system healthy 
          and up to date is often underestimated. Any organisation would require a specific role to lead 
          initiatives on these aspects, but is not always the case,

          Nobody likes slow queries. Data must be fluid to enhance decisions 
          and move business forward. Sometimes queries can be written better, while in other cases
          tables' structure can be optimised. Moreover, queries' writing style must be
          consistent, allowing a smart reuse of the code already written.
