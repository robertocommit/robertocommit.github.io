        <div class="content">
          The way an organisation implement and structure a Business Intelligence software
          is one of the first signals about potential inefficiencies and data bottle necks.
          Often from inside an organisation, it is not possibile to understand opportunities 
          and limitation, because sense of involvment and too much consuetude. This is why having 
          a professional looking at the tool from different angles it is extremely important.

        <b>BI Maintenance</b>
        <div class="content">
          A Business Intelligence software requires regular maintenance. From managing permissions to 
          relocate queries, the number of daily hidden small tasks necessary to keep a system healty 
          and up to date is often underestimate. Any organisation would require a specific role to take 
          care of these aspects, but it is not always the case. Externalise this activity is a 
          brave decision able soon pay to high dividends.

          Nobody likes slow queries. Data needs to be deliver fast to enahnce decisions 
          and move the business forward. Sometimes queries can be written better, while in other cases
          tables' structure can be optimised allowing faster results. Moreover, queries' style must be
          consistent, allowing a smart reuse of the code already written.

        <b>Crawling</b>
        <div class="content">
          Any company faces the need to extract data from the web. For a multitude of reasons, having
          the possibility to acquire data previously not available can lead to a competititive advantage.
          Data are out there, but often not easy to access, because of time constrains or technical limitations.
          Rely on reilable and scalable web crawers to bring your data to a next level.

        <b>Features Engineering</b>
        <div class="content">
          The biggest part of a machine learning project is the iterative process of
          features defining and features improvement. This activity can be considered boring
          from a data scientist point of view, because it is not directly connected with the algorithms behind the learning pipeline. However, this part is crucial and important as the algorithm itself if not even more.
          Get support and help not only to define features, but also produce and manintain them.
